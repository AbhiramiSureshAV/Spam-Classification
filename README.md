# Spam-Classification

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based spam email classifier. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning models to identify spam emails. The dataset includes raw text emails labeled as spam or not spam.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, lemmatization, removal of stop words, etc.).
- Visualization of data distributions.
- Handling of imbalanced datasets using SMOTE.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes

## Requirements
The required Python libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Spam Email raw text for NLP.csv`. Ensure that this file is in the same directory as the notebook.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies:
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`SPAM CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`) and run the cells sequentially.

## Results
The project evaluates various classifiers using metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Visualization of results is provided for better understanding.
